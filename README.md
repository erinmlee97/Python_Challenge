Python Challenge

## Background

In this challenge, I used pandas to read in a csv file. Using the different csv files, I was able to use functions to determine certain variables within the data.

## Data

* budget_data.csv
* election_data.csv

## PyBank

Using the budget_data.csv, I was able to find the following:
* Total Months
* Net total amount of Profit/Losses
* Average change over entire period
* Greatest increase in profits (date & amount) over entire period
* Greatest decrease in profits (date & amount) over entire period

### Analysis

``` Fianancial Analysis

Average Change: $7803.48
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 $1926159
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 $-2196167
```


## PyPoll
Using the election_data.csv, I was able to find the following:

* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who recieved votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote

### Analysis
